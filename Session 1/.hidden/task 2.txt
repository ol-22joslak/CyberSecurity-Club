Congrats, you found the hidden file. For your next task, you will need to decode the base64 file.

To decode a base64 file, use the command:

==============================================
base64 -d name-of-file-to-decode
==============================================

This will print the name decoded contents of the file to the terminal.

Base64 encoded files end in .b64

Good Luck.
